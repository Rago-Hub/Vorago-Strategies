      "description": "Cade cept means using <:intercept:811607916196266024> during <:Barricade:612343091621527572>\n\nBarricade-intercepting is extremely simple. Activate <:Barricade:612343091621527572> then cast <:intercept:811607916196266024> on any player that you want to protect from damage. While you are cade cepting or staying under the effect of cade cept from another player it is highly recommended to use Heal Other <:healother:812041131290001482> on your duo partner or the team member with the lowest life points. Base and Bomb Tank should be prioritized.\n\n**Extending Barricade**\n• Turtling perk \n• Malletops\n\nIf you extended your cade long enough to have well above 10 seconds of duration it is recommended to refresh <:intercept:811607916196266024> once the cade timer reaches 11 seconds left. Additionally it is possible to cast Heal Other heal twice within your <:Barricade:612343091621527572> if casted early on. Note that you should also heal heal if you are the one being intercepted not only if you are the one barricading.\n\n**Forcing Red Bomb**\n• Red Bombs <:redbomb:508944149257519104> always go to the person standing farthest away from Vorago\n• If multiple players are in melee distance and no other person out any farther out, the Base Tank will be targeted with the Red Bomb\n• Random Red Bombs (rare occurrence): Vorago targets a random player with the Red Bomb\n\n• Step in melee distance or beneath Vorago\n• Wait for the <:redbomb:508944149257519104> to be launched\n• Cade cept <:Barricade:612343091621527572> cept all players\n• Step back out again\n• Cast Heal Other <:healother:812041131290001482> on the team member with the lowest life points\n\nAlternating <:Barricade:612343091621527572> cooldowns for every Red Bomb <:redbomb:508944149257519104> in phase 2 is significantly important.",
