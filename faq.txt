	"value": "Turtling 4 increases barricade cooldown by 6 seconds over Turtling 3. In phase 4, when the base performs a clone skip, this drastically decreases the phase length.\nAs a result, if Barricade is used with a turtling shield to handle the first set of mechanics in Phase 4, it will not be off cooldown for the second cycle. This can lead to killing team members.\nA non-turtling shield is also required to deal with these mechanics properly."

	"value": "Accuracy is the biggest issue at Vorago and can lead to frustrating phase lengths and more supplies used. It is important to mitigate that RNG factor as much as possible, and that can be done by using Nihils. Ice Nihils however, are not allowed, as they cause Scopuli to change the focus of their aggression frequently, which can lead to killing teammates and more importantly the Bomb Tank."

	"name":"Why is  Cryptbloom armour not allowed?",
	"value": "Damage received at Vorago is relatively low. A good rotation of defensives, Soulsplit flicks, heal-other and intercepts will mitigate almost all of the damage. It is very common to not need food unless large mistakes are made, making Cryptbloom's effect useless and give a negative impact on the kill speed. Sometimes you will effectively receive more damage because the damage loss from the armour caused a phase to be longer than usual."
