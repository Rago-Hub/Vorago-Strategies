	"value": "Turtling is a perk that increases your barricade duration while increasing its cooldown. In phase 4, when the base performs a clone skip, this drastically decreases the phase length.\nAs a result, if Barricade is used with a turtling shield to handle the first set of mechanics in Phase 4, it is not off cooldown for the second set of mechanics. This can lead to killing team members.\nWe require a non-turtling shield in presets so people can use this shield for phase 4 to handle  all mechanics appropriately."

	"name":"Why are Nihils used (and why are Ice Nihils not permitted)?",
	"value": "Vorago is a boss that has incredibly high affinity, resulting in extremely poor hitchance. Even with affinity debuffs such as Statius Warhammer special attack, and Guthix Staff, hitchance is far from 100%. Nihils are used to increase accuracy against Vorago and are important to use in order to achieve smooth kills. All learners are required to use Nihils. Ice Nihils, however, are not allowed. Ice Nihils can cause Scopuli (minions spawned by Vorago during one of his weekly rotations) to change the focus of their aggression frequently, which can lead to killing team members."

	"name":"Why are the Wen/Jas Scriptures not allowed?",
	"value": "The Wen and Jas scriptures both have an effect that causes a delayed hit at random times. This can lead to pk'ing your teammates should this happen during Vorago's reflect mechanic, where he redirects any damage done to him onto a random member of the team. After testing, these scriptures were banned due to this. Further, these effects are random and uncontrolled. It is entirely feasible that the scriptures would not activate during one of the DPS phases of the kill, thus being redundant.\nAs a learner you may use Saradomin's Godbook or a Scrimshaw of Elements/Cruelty."

	"name":"Why is  Cryptbloom armour not allowed?",
	"value": "The damage received at Vorago is relatively low, due to the ability to use strategies focused around Barricade, Intercept and Heal Other during time-gated phases, and in the transition between phases. As a result, it is incredibly common not to need food unless large mistakes are made during the kill, and there is a significant reduction in damage output for the dps phases compared to using power armour. As a result of it not being necessary, and causing slower damage phases, Tank Armour is not permitted for Vorago sessions."

	"value": "Core strategies used to handle mechanics at Vorago are centred around Barricade, the Intercept spell, and Heal Other spell. Intercept is on the Ancient Spellbook, and Heal Other is on the Lunar Spellbook. As it is not possible to swap from the Normal to Ancient/Lunar spellbooks, Base Tank and Bomb Tank learners are required to be on a non-standard spellbook. Learners using Magic should be on the Ancient spellbook and have runes to swap to the Lunar spellbook. Ranged learners can either default to the Ancient or Lunar Spellbook, and be able to swap to its counterpart."
