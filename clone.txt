In other words, the Base Tank never receives a Stone Clone. It has been discovered in scenarios where you end in a Solo Phase 4, that Vorago will bug for a few ticks and then proceed with the weekly special, skipping the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks completely.\n\nDue to the Base Tank being the only visible player in the arena, Vorago will skip the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks.\nInstead of creating the Stone Clone, Vorago will skips all 7 auto attacks which saves `0,6 seconds x 4 x 7 x 2`: **a total of 33,6 seconds**.\nAfter this, Vorago will continue his attack order with the weekly special mechanic."

It is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5/10 Barricade."
