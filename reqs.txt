__**Do not argue about requirements.**__
Our gear requirements have been discussed extensively and are reviewed every few months to ensure that all role and team expectations can be met so consistent kills can be achieved.
Every team member is expected to meet these requirements, deal with mechanics and contribute to DPS correctly.

These requirements are not up for debate. Any further arguments will result in us closing the ticket with no further discussion.
