__**Do not argue about requirements.**__
Our gear requirements have been discussed extensively and are reviewed every few months to ensure that all role and team expectations can be met so consistent kills can be achieved.
Every team member is expected to meet these requirements and contribute with damage and dealing with mechanics.

They are not up for debate and if you do not agree you are welcome to teamform elsewhere until you can meet all the requirements that we set for teamforming.
