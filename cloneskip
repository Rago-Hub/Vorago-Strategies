In other words, the Base Tank never receives a Stone Clone. It has been discovered in scenarios where you end in a Solo Phase 4, that Vorago will bug for a few ticks and then proceed with the weekly special, skipping the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks completely.\n\nDue to the Base Tank being the only visible player in the arena, Vorago will skip the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks.\nInstead of creating the Stone Clone, Vorago will skips all 7 auto attacks which saves `0,6 seconds x 4 x 7 x 2`: **a total of 33,6 seconds**.\nAfter this, Vorago will continue his attack order with the weekly special mechanic.\n\n**The skip can be done in any team size and in both NM and HM**.\n\n*Image [reference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/671035860111589396/811747161834389504/unknown.png) of walking Vorago & positioning properly*.\n\n__Recommended Execution__\n• Toggle Run OFF once you enter the Waterfall\n• Post-Waterfall: Barge or Surge as your first ability\n*Note*: On Team Split use the Mobile perk with Barge if you plan on breaking the TS (reference: `.breakingts`)\n• Go under Vorago and move him towards his walking direction\n• Toggle Run ON as Vorago reaches the wall\n• The moment that Vorago starts moving, all other players should immediately position at the opposite side of his walking direction (use Surge and Bladed Dive)\n• Once the Stone Clone special mechanic is skipped, move back to the Base Tank\n\n__Cooldown Management__\nDue to the time saved, Barricade will mostly be on cooldown for the weekly special. It is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5/10 Barricade.",
