      "description": "During the Reflect mechanic (also commonly called \"Link\") Vorago redirects all damage dealt to him to a random player. At the beginning of the mechanic Vorago raises his arm and the linked player will receive a chat warning saying:\n`Vorago channels incoming damage to you. Beware!`\nAt the end of the mechanic, a swirling green animation occurs around the linked player and the same player will receive a chat warning saying:\n`Vorago releases his mental link on you.`\nIn Hard Mode, no chat messages appear.\n\n• Damage type: According to the player's attack style\n• Damage dealt: 100-200% of the original damage dealt by the player\n    - Weak abilities like Combust tend to hit low\n    - Strong abilities like Dragon Breath are likely to one-hit a teammate regardless of the damage modifier\n• Duration: 16 ticks / 9.6 seconds\n• Linked targets: 1\n    - 2 if team size is greater than 11\n    - In Hard Mode both the player attacking and the player linked receive damage\n    - In Hard Mode the cap for linked players is raised to 4\n• Reflect clears any bleeds and dots applied to Vorago\n\n",
