It has been discovered in scenarios where you end in a Solo Phase 4, that Vorago will bug for a few ticks and then proceed with the weekly special, skipping the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks completely.\n\nIn place of creating the Stone Clone, Vorago bugs for 12 ticks and skips all 7 auto attacks which saves `0,6 seconds x 4 x 7 x 2`: a total of 33,6 seconds.\n\n*Image [reference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/500971699349749760/811570519799234570/unknown.png) of walking Vorago & positioning properly*.\n\n__Recommended Execution__\n• Toggle off running once you enter the Waterfall\n• Post-Waterfall: Barge or Surge as your first ability\n*Note*: On Team Split use the Mobile perk with Barge if you plan on breaking the TS (reference: `.breakingts`)\n• Walk towards Vorago's walking direction (do not run)\n• Toggle on running as Vorago reaches the wall\n• Due to the Base Tank being the only visible player in the arena, Vorago will skip the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks\n• Vorago will continue his attack order with the weekly special mechanic\n• The moment that Vorago starts moving, all other players should immediately position at the opposite side of Vorago's walking direction (utilise Surge and Bladed Dive)\n• Once the Stone Clone special mechanic is skipped, move back to the Base Tank\n\n__Cooldown Management__\nDue to the incredible amount of time gained by a Clone Skip, Barricade will mostly be on cooldown for the weekly special. Due to this it is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5 / 10 Barricade.",
