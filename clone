In team sizes Duo and above, you can trick Vorago into thinking it is a Solo, and therefore skip the Stone Clone + 7 autos by going under Vorago so that he starts walking, and following his walk direction. This is to start the process of moving Vorago to a wall.\n\nDue to the Base Tank being the only visible player in the arena, Vorago will skip the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks.\nInstead of creating the Stone Clone, Vorago will skips all 7 auto attacks which saves `0,6 seconds x 4 x 7 x 2`: a total of 33,6 seconds. After this, Vorago will continue his attack order with the weekly special mechanic.\n\n*Image [reference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/500971699349749760/811570519799234570/unknown.png) of walking Vorago & positioning properly*.\n\n__Recommended Execution__\n• Toggle Run OFF once you enter the Waterfall\n• Post-Waterfall: Barge or Surge as your first ability\n*Note*: On Team Split use the Mobile perk with Barge if you plan on breaking the TS (reference: `.breakingts`)\n• Go under Vorago and move him towards his walking direction\n• Toggle Run ON as Vorago reaches the wall\n• The moment that Vorago starts moving, all other players should immediately position at the opposite side of his walking direction (use Surge and Bladed Dive)\n• Once the Stone Clone special mechanic is skipped, move back to the Base Tank\n\n__Cooldown Management__\nDue to the time saved, Barricade will mostly be on cooldown for the weekly special. It is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5 / 10 Barricade.",
